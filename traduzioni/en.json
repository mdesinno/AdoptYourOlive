    "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faqSubtitle": "Find answers to common questions about adopting an olive tree.",
    "faqServiceTitle": "What is the \"Adopt Your Olive\" service?",
    "faqServiceAnswer": "\"Adopt Your Olive\" offers you the unique opportunity to symbolically adopt an authentic Peranzana olive tree from our family-run farm in San Severo, Puglia. With your adoption, you support our sustainable farming practices and receive a share of the precious extra virgin olive oil produced, along with other exclusive benefits that connect you to our land and tradition.",
    "faqAdoptionMeaningTitle": "What does \"adopting an olive tree\" exactly mean?",
    "faqAdoptionMeaningAnswer": "Adopting an olive tree means creating a special bond with a specific tree in our grove for one year. You don't become the legal owner of the tree, but you symbolically contribute to its care and cultivation. In return, we recognize you as an 'adoptive parent' with a personalized certificate, updates, and, most importantly, the oil produced by your tree (or equivalent from our Peranzana production).",
    "faqTreeTypeOilTitle": "What kind of olive tree can I adopt and what is the oil variety?",
    "faqTreeTypeOilAnswer": "You can choose between different types of olive trees, such as 'Young', 'Mature', or 'Centenary', each with a different amount of oil included in the adoption package. All our trees are of the prized Peranzana variety, native to our region, which produces an extra virgin olive oil with a medium fruitiness, hints of tomato and almond, and a pleasant, slightly spicy and bitter aftertaste, indicative of high quality and richness in polyphenols.",
    "faqWhatReceiveTitle": "What exactly do I receive with the adoption?",
    "faqWhatReceiveAnswer": "Depending on the package chosen (Young, Mature, or Centenary Olive Tree), you will receive a specific quantity of Peranzana extra virgin olive oil (5, 10, or 15 liters) in elegant, personalized packaging with your name. Additionally, you will get an official adoption certificate with your name and an optional message, periodic updates with photos and news from our olive grove, and invitations to participate in exclusive events like the olive harvest (when possible).",
    "faqCostTitle": "How much does it cost to adopt an olive tree?",
    "faqCostAnswer": "We offer different adoption plans to suit all needs. Prices vary based on the type of tree and the amount of oil included. You can find all the details and updated prices in our <a href=\"#products\" style=\"color: var(--primary-green); text-decoration: underline;\">'Adopt an Olive Tree'</a> section. Remember that shipping to many European countries is included in the price!",
    "faqOrganicTitle": "Is the olive oil I will receive organic?",
    "faqOrganicAnswer": "Our family cultivates olive trees using traditional and sustainable methods, with full respect for nature and the land. Although we do not yet have official organic certification for all plots, our agricultural practices aim to minimize environmental impact and ensure a genuine, high-quality product. We are committed to a path of continuous improvement towards increasingly eco-compatible practices.",
    "faqPeranzanaSpecialTitle": "What makes Peranzana extra virgin olive oil special?",
    "faqPeranzanaSpecialAnswer": "Peranzana oil is a Puglian excellence. It is a monovarietal oil, meaning it is produced exclusively from Peranzana olives. This gives it a unique aromatic profile: an elegant fruitiness with distinct notes of green tomato, artichoke, and almond. It has a perfect balance between bitter and spicy, typical of high-quality oils rich in antioxidants. It is versatile in the kitchen, excellent both raw and for delicate cooking.",
    "faqWhenReceiveOilTitle": "When will I receive my olive oil?",
    "faqWhenReceiveOilAnswer": "The olive harvest typically takes place between October and November. Afterward, the olives are pressed, and the oil is left to settle naturally before bottling. Shipments of the oil related to the adoption season usually begin in the spring following the harvest (e.g., oil from the Autumn 2025 harvest will be shipped in Spring 2026). We will keep you updated on all phases!",
    "faqShippingTitle": "Is shipping included? To which countries do you ship for free?",
    "faqShippingAnswer": "Yes, shipping is free and included in the adoption cost for the following countries: Italy, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Spain, Switzerland, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Austria, Belgium, and Finland. If your country is not on this list, please contact us for a personalized shipping quote.",
    "faqGiftTitle": "Can I gift an olive tree adoption to someone else?",
    "faqGiftAnswer": "Absolutely! Adopting an olive tree is a wonderful, original, and meaningful gift. During the personalization process, you can enter the recipient's name for the adoption certificate and add a personal message. The oil and all benefits will be sent to the shipping address you provide.",
    "faqUpdatesTitle": "How and how often will I receive updates about my tree?",
    "faqUpdatesAnswer": "We will send you periodic updates via email (about 3-4 times a year) with photographs of your tree (or the olive grove in general) and news about the various seasonal phases: from flowering to olive growth, up to the harvest. We want you to feel involved in the life of our olive grove.",
    "faqVisitTitle": "Can I visit my adopted tree?",
    "faqVisitAnswer": "We would be delighted to welcome you to our farm! We periodically organize special events and days dedicated to adopters, during which you can visit the olive grove and, weather permitting, see your tree up close. You will receive invitations and information about these events. For individual visits at other times, please contact us in advance to check availability.",
    "faqLearnMoreTitle": "How can I learn more about the farming process and your company?",
    "faqLearnMoreAnswer": "We share our passion and information about olive cultivation and oil production through the 'Our Story' section on this website, via periodic updates sent to adopters, and on our social media channels. Furthermore, participating in our harvest events is a great way to learn directly in the field!",
