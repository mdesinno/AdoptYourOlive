  "faqCat1_Title": "About the Service",
  "faqQ1_Title": "What exactly is \"Adopt Your Olive\"?",
  "faqQ1_Answer": "\"Adopt Your Olive\" is a service that allows you to create a direct bond with our farm in Puglia through the symbolic adoption of a Peranzana olive tree. With your adoption, you support our sustainable farming practices, follow the life of a specific tree for a year, and receive its fruits at home in the form of high-quality extra virgin olive oil and other exclusive benefits.",
  "faqQ2_Title": "What exactly do I receive with my adoption?",
  "faqQ2_Answer": "Each adoption (valid for 12 months) always includes our core benefits: a physical adoption certificate with a photo of your tree, a personalized plaque we place on the olive tree, periodic updates, and access to the exclusive AYO Adopters Club. In addition to these, oil (with personalized labels) is included depending on the package:<ul><li><strong>Young Olive Tree:</strong> Includes all core benefits but <strong>does not include a supply of oil</strong>.</li><li><strong>Mature Olive Tree:</strong> Includes core benefits + <strong>5 liters of oil</strong> (one 3L tin and four 500ml bottles).</li><li><strong>Ancient Olive Tree:</strong> Includes core benefits + <strong>10 liters of oil</strong> (two 3L tins and eight 500ml bottles).</li><li><strong>Historic Olive Tree:</strong> Includes core benefits + <strong>15 liters of oil</strong> (two 5L tins and ten 500ml bottles).</li></ul>",
  "faqQ3_Title": "What makes Peranzana olive oil special?",
  "faqQ3_Answer": "The Peranzana is a rare and prized cultivar from Puglia. Its oil is exceptional for its perfect balance: it has a medium-light fruitiness with hints of tomato, artichoke, and almond, and a slightly bitter and spicy aftertaste that indicates high quality and richness in polyphenols. It is an extremely versatile and appreciated oil, hard to find in large-scale retail.",
  "faqQ4_Title": "Does adopting a tree make me the owner?",
  "faqQ4_Answer": "No, the adoption is symbolic and lasts for 12 months. It does not involve the transfer of legal ownership of the tree or the land. With the adoption, you become an 'adoptive parent' and a direct supporter of our agriculture, creating a personal bond with the land and receiving the fruits of your sponsorship in return.",
  "faqQ5_Title": "What is the AYO Adopters Club?",
  "faqQ5_Answer": "It is an exclusive club for those who adopt a tree. It gives you access to a private group (currently on Telegram) where we offer special deals for the purchase of exclusive seasonal packages throughout the year.",
  "faqCat2_Title": "Logistics & Commercial Details",
  "faqQ6_Title": "When will I receive the certificate and the oil?",
  "faqQ6_Answer": "Shipments occur at two different times:<ul><li><strong>Certificate and photo:</strong> These are shipped within 5 business days of your order, at any time of the year.</li><li><strong>Oil (if included):</strong> The shipment depends on when you adopt. For orders from June to November, the new oil is shipped in December. For orders from December to May, the ready-made oil is shipped within 5 business days.</li></ul>",
  "faqQ7_Title": "Are shipping and VAT included in the price?",
  "faqQ7_Answer": "Yes. The prices you see on the website are final and include both VAT and shipping costs for all European Union countries, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland. For shipments to other destinations, please contact us before placing your order for a custom quote.",
  "faqQ8_Title": "Can I gift an adoption?",
  "faqQ8_Answer": "Certainly. During the checkout process, you can enter the recipient's name and shipping address. To ensure they also receive the periodic email updates, we ask that you provide us with their email address after completing the order by replying to your order confirmation.",
  "faqQ9_Title": "Do I have the right of withdrawal?",
  "faqQ9_Answer": "Under current law (Art. 59 of the Italian Consumer Code), the right of withdrawal is excluded for the supply of personalized goods (certificates, plaques, labels) and for sealed goods that are not suitable for return for hygiene reasons (such as olive oil once opened). The adoption service, being of immediate execution, is also excluded.",
  "faqQ10_Title": "How long does the adoption last and how do I renew?",
  "faqQ10_Answer": "The adoption is valid for 12 months from the date of purchase. There is no automatic renewal. Before it expires, we will send you an email with a renewal proposal for the following year, so you can decide freely whether to continue supporting your tree.",
  "faqQ14_Title": "Do you accept payments in foreign currencies?",
"faqQ14_Answer": "Yes, our payment system powered by Stripe accepts payments from cards and wallets in most currencies. However, all our prices are displayed and processed in Euros (€). If you pay with a card in a different currency (e.g., GBP or CHF), your bank or card issuer will handle the currency conversion. Please be aware that they may apply their own exchange rate and a foreign transaction fee. These potential charges are not controlled by Adopt Your Olive.",  "faqCat3_Title": "Support & Troubleshooting",
  "faqQ11_Title": "What if I have concerns about the product's quality?",
  "faqQ11_Answer": "Quality is our top priority. If upon receiving the product you notice damage due to transport or a lack of conformity, please contact us immediately at <strong>info@adoptyourolive.com</strong>. As described in our <a href=\"shipping-returns.html\">Shipping & Returns</a> policy, we will ask you to provide photos of the damage and your order number to best assist you with a replacement or refund, where applicable.",
  "faqQ12_Title": "I haven't received your confirmation/update email.",
  "faqQ12_Answer": "Sometimes, automated emails can end up in 'Promotions' or 'Spam' folders. We ask you to check these folders in your inbox. To ensure you always receive our communications, we recommend adding our address <strong>info@adoptyourolive.com</strong> to your contact list.",
  "faqQ13_Title": "Can I come and visit my tree?",
  "faqQ13_Answer": "We are a family-run farm and, although we do not currently have a structured program for visits, we are happy to welcome our adoptive parents. If you are planning to come to Puglia and wish to see your tree, please contact us with some advance notice at <strong>info@adoptyourolive.com</strong>, and we will do our best to arrange a time to meet you.",

"guideHeaderSubtitle": "For Members of the “Adopt Your Olive” Club",
"guideIntroTitle": "Introduction – A Liquid Heritage",
"guideIntroText": "The Peranzana is not just an olive: it is a fragment of Puglian history. Introduced in San Severo by the Prince of Sangro from Provence, France, its name derives from the dialect form of “Provençal”. Tasting this oil means immersing oneself in a narrative of territory, climate, and farming tradition, transformed into a complete sensory experience.",
"guideIntroText2": "This guide will lead you step-by-step through the three official phases of professional tasting – with techniques, panel test tricks, and specific references to our Peranzana – so you can distinguish, understand, and describe its qualities like a true expert.",
"guideVisualTitle": "Phase 1 – Visual Examination",
"guideVisualToolsTitle": "Tools and Context",
"guideVisualToolsText": "Professional tasters use a thick, cobalt blue glass to prevent color from influencing their judgment. At home, you can use a small glass (about 15 ml of oil, or one tablespoon), avoiding direct light sources.",
"guideVisualObserveTitle": "What to Observe",
"guideVisualPoint1": "<strong>Fluidity:</strong> The Peranzana presents with a silky consistency, a sign of freshness and proper filtration.",
"guideVisualPoint2": "<strong>Color:</strong> It can range from deep green with golden reflections (early harvest) to golden yellow with green hues (harvest at optimal ripeness). Remember: <em>color is not an indicator of quality</em>.",
"guideVisualTip": "Expert's note: Any tiny sediments at the bottom indicate an unfiltered oil, chosen by some producers to preserve complex aromas. However, organic suspension accelerates degradation: for this reason, in the Club, we only deliver filtered oil, which is stable and stays fresh longer.",
"guideOlfactoryTitle": "Phase 2 – Olfactory Examination",
"guideOlfactoryPrepTitle": "Preparation",
"guideOlfactoryPrepText": "Warm the glass in the palm of your hand, covering it with the other to trap the aromas. Rotate it slowly: the heat will release the aromatic molecules.",
"guideOlfactoryProfileTitle": "Typical Aromatic Profile of Excellent Peranzana",
"guideOlfactoryPoint1": "Medium-intense fruitiness with distinct notes of green tomato and tomato leaf.",
"guideOlfactoryPoint2": "Fresh almond, a delicate sweetness that balances the herbaceous profile.",
"guideOlfactoryPoint3": "Cut grass and light notes of artichoke, a sign of high richness in polyphenols.",
"guideOlfactoryDefects": "Defects to identify (and reject): <br> <strong>Rancid</strong> – the smell of old nuts, a sign of oxidation.<br> <strong>Winey-Vinegary</strong> – recalls vinegar or wine, indicating abnormal fermentation.<br> <strong>Musty-Humid</strong> – an aroma of dampness or wet wood, due to poorly stored olives.",
"guideGustatoryTitle": "Phase 3 – Gustatory Examination",
"guideGustatoryTechTitle": "The “Strippaggio” Technique",
"guideGustatoryTechText": "Take a small sip and spread it throughout your mouth. Keep the oil between your teeth and lips and inhale rapidly with clenched teeth: the air carries the aromas to the retronasal cavity, amplifying perceptions.",
"guideGustatoryFeelTitle": "What to Perceive",
"guideGustatoryPoint1": "<strong>Bitter:</strong> felt on the tongue, linked to the presence of beneficial phenolic compounds.",
"guideGustatoryPoint2": "<strong>Pungent:</strong> a peppery sensation in the throat, more or less persistent, a sign of freshness and a high concentration of antioxidants.",
"guideGustatoryPoint3": "<strong>Balance:</strong> in Peranzana, bitterness and pungency are harmoniously balanced, leaving a clean, persistent aftertaste of almond and tomato.",
"guideGustatoryTip": "Almost everyone coughs on the first try: it's the peppery kick that confirms the freshness and richness in polyphenols.",
"guideGustatoryCuriosity": "Sommelier's curiosity: a slight sensation of “allappamento” (astringency) is normal and indicates oils rich in polyphenols.",
"guideExtraTip": "Suggestion: before tasting or between samples, eat a piece of green apple. It helps to “reset” the palate and better perceive the nuances of the oil.",
"guideStorageTitle": "Optimal Storage",
"guideStoragePoint1": "<strong>Light:</strong> avoid direct exposure, prefer dark environments.",
"guideStoragePoint2": "<strong>Temperature:</strong> 14–18°C, never near heat sources.",
"guideStoragePoint3": "<strong>Oxygen:</strong> always reseal the container and minimize the time between opening and consumption.",
"guideStorageNote": "For Club members, our oil is packaged in containers designed to protect every drop until the last day of optimal consumption.",
