    "faqSubtitle": "Find answers to common questions about adopting an olive tree.",
    "faqServiceTitle": "What is the \"Adopt Your Olive\" service?",
    "faqServiceAnswer": "\"Adopt Your Olive\" offers you the unique opportunity to symbolically adopt an authentic Peranzana olive tree from our family-run farm in San Severo, Puglia. With your adoption, you support our sustainable farming practices and receive a share of the precious extra virgin olive oil produced, along with other exclusive benefits that connect you to our land and tradition.",
    "faqAdoptionMeaningTitle": "What does \"adopting an olive tree\" exactly mean?",
    "faqAdoptionMeaningAnswerNew": "Adopting an olive tree means creating a special bond with a specific tree in our grove for one year. You don't become the legal owner of the tree, but you symbolically contribute to its care and cultivation. Each adopted tree gets a personalized tag with your name, and we'll send you photos of your specific tree. In return, we recognize you as an 'adoptive parent' with a personalized certificate, updates, and, most importantly, the oil produced (or equivalent from our Peranzana production).",
    "faqTreeTypeOilTitle": "What kind of olive tree can I adopt and what is the oil variety?",
    "faqTreeTypeOilAnswer": "You can choose between different types of olive trees, such as 'Young', 'Mature', or 'Centenary', each with a different amount of oil included in the adoption package. All our trees are of the prized Peranzana variety, native to our region, which produces an extra virgin olive oil with a medium fruitiness, hints of tomato and almond, and a pleasant, slightly spicy and bitter aftertaste, indicative of high quality and richness in polyphenols.",
    "faqWhatReceiveTitle": "What exactly do I receive with the adoption?",
    "faqWhatReceiveAnswer": "Depending on the package chosen, you will receive a specific quantity of oil (5, 10, or 15 liters) in personalized packaging, an official adoption certificate with your name and an optional message, and periodic updates with photos from our olive grove.",
    "faqPeranzanaSpecialTitleNew": "What makes Peranzana olives special and is the oil really fresh?",
    "faqPeranzanaSpecialAnswerNew": "Peranzana is one of Puglia's rarest varieties, producing oil with exceptional balance - not too intense, not too mild, perfect for daily use and special occasions. It's a monovarietal oil with an elegant fruitiness and distinct notes of green tomato, artichoke, and almond. And yes, the oil is incredibly fresh! We harvest in November and ship your oil by December. This means you receive oil that's weeks old, not months or even years like some store-bought imports.",
    "faqShippingTitleNew": "How long does shipping take and is it included?",
    "faqShippingAnswerNew": "Yes, shipping is free and included for all European Union countries, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland. For shipping to other destinations, please contact us to check for feasibility and receive a custom quote.",
    "faqGiftTitle": "Can I gift an olive tree adoption to someone else?",
    "faqGiftAnswer": "Absolutely! Adopting an olive tree is a wonderful, original, and meaningful gift. During the personalization process, you can enter the recipient's name for the adoption certificate and add a personal message. The oil and all benefits will be sent to the shipping address you provide.",
    "faqQualityConcernsTitle": "What if I have quality concerns?",
    "faqQualityConcernsAnswer": "We stand behind our oil quality. Our family has been producing exceptional Puglian oil for decades, and we're committed to your satisfaction. If you have any concerns upon receiving your oil, please contact us immediately.",
    "faqDeliveryTitle": "I haven't received your email, what can I do?",
    "faqDeliveryAnswer": "Sometimes automated emails can land in the 'Promotions' or 'Spam' folders. Please check these folders in your mailbox. To ensure you always receive our communications, we recommend adding our email address to your contacts.",
